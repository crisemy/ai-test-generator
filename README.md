An intelligent web tool that automatically generates high-quality test cases, Playwright automation scripts, and prioritizes them using ML-based risk scoring — built for fintech and SaaS quality engineering.

---

## Key Features

### Core Generation
- Generate **10–15 structured test cases** (Gherkin-style: Given / When / Then) from a plain-English User Story
- Produce **ready-to-run Playwright Python scripts** for the highest-risk scenarios
- Choose between **Llama 3.3 70B**, Llama 3.1 8B, or Mixtral models via Groq API

### ML Risk Intelligence
- Apply **Random Forest ML risk scoring** to every generated test case — predicts a `High / Medium / Low` risk label and confidence score (0–100)
- All test cases are **automatically sorted by descending risk score** so critical tests always surface first
- Interactive **ML Risk Dashboard** with bar charts showing the risk distribution of generated tests

### SHAP Model Explainability
- Dedicated **SHAP Explainability tab** powered by `shap.TreeExplainer`
- Renders a **Waterfall Plot** for any selected test case, showing exactly which features pushed the risk score up or down
- Makes the model fully transparent and interpretable — ideal for QA Architects presenting to engineering leadership

### Batch Backlog Prioritization 
- Upload a **CSV backlog** of any size (e.g., a Jira export) with a `story` or `description` column
- The ML model scores **every row instantly** — no LLM calls needed, no rate limits
- Results table is **interactive**: select the riskiest story and send it directly to the LLM generator with one click
- Download the **`StoryExample.csv`** template from the UI to get started immediately

### Enterprise-Grade Export
- Downloadable **ZIP outputs a full Playwright POM Framework** — not just a loose script:
  - `pages/` — base Page Object Model class
  - `tests/` — LLM-generated test scripts, correctly structured
  - `pytest.ini` — pre-configured pytest setup
  - `requirements.txt` — framework dependencies
  - `.github/workflows/qa-regression.yml` — **GitHub Actions CI pipeline**, ready to push and run

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crisemy/ai-test-generator.git
   cd ai-test-generator
   ```
   > A set of `.sh` helper scripts is provided in the `init-scripts/` folder for quick repo and environment bootstrapping on macOS.

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   # .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your Groq API key**  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
   Get a free key at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys).

5. **(One-time) Train the risk model**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/risk_model_training.ipynb
   ```
   This generates `data/risk_model.pkl` and `data/label_encoder.pkl`.

6. **Launch the app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## How It Works

1. **Input** — Paste a User Story in plain English, click a Quick Start example, or upload a CSV backlog.
2. **Batch Filter *(optional)*** — If using CSV mode: the ML model scores the entire backlog instantly. Pick the highest-risk story from the ranked results table.
3. **Generation** — Groq LLM (Llama 3.3 70B) creates 10–15 structured test cases + Playwright scripts for the top risk scenarios.
4. **ML Risk Scoring** — Features are extracted from each test case (financial keywords, security terms, complexity proxies) → the Random Forest predicts the risk label and confidence score.
5. **SHAP Explainability** — Select any test case to view a Waterfall Plot explaining which features drove that prediction. Full model transparency.
6. **Prioritization** — All test cases are ranked by descending risk score in the "Risk Prioritized Table" tab.
7. **Enterprise Export** — Download a production-ready ZIP containing a Playwright POM framework + GitHub Actions CI pipeline ready to push and run.
